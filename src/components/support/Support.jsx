    <p className='psp'>We live in a society where people rely on one another to meet their daily
        necessities. From relying on farmers and Sabziwalas for veggies and fruits
         to your employers and coworkers for job and livelihood, and your pals for 
         expressing and contributing joy to your life. We want our lives to be planned
          and managed, similarly, we also want our living/working environments and 
          surrounding to be clean and hygienic. This is done by the cleanliness
           community, also known as sanitation workers and domestic help. 
           They work from daylight to night cleaning our homes, streets, offices,
            sewage systems, and so on for the bare minimum salary. They didn't make 
            enough money to make ends meet. Some of them are still without basic 
            necessities such as housing, electricity, and running water. They are 
            also uninformed of their rights as domestic workers and laborers. They
             are ignorant of the safety gear and government plans put in place for them. </p>
